## Implementation
Which features you included

- Better selection when selecting blocks. It is now very apparent which block you have selected
- Particles when block is removed
- Block gets pushed forward and then falls down when matched
- Block rotates when falling down
- Screen shake intensified per each block removed
- "Incredible!" effect when more than 5 blocks are removed *at once* (if 6 blocks are removed, then another 6 fall into place and *those* get removed, incredible effect will not show)
- Icons and better font in the main menu
- "Level 2" (extra row of blocks)
- End game screen (after level 2)
- Ability to pause and unpause the game with Esc/Enter
- Background video
- Background music by [Eric Matyas](https://soundimage.org/puzzle-music-3/)
- Sfx when moving pieces, and when pieces "die".
- Not really a juicy effect or anything, but refactored some code from the original template repo
- Smoother movement of pieces when swapping
